# AI Agent Instructions for Project Nightfall

## Core Principles

### 1. Keep It Simple
- Build only what is explicitly requested
- No over-engineering or complex architectures
- Focus on the current task, not future possibilities

### 2. No Future-Proofing
- Don't add "extensible" systems unless specifically asked
- Avoid creating abstract layers or frameworks
- Write direct, simple code that works now

### 3. Minimal Dependencies
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only
- No frameworks, libraries, or build tools unless explicitly requested
- Keep everything in simple, readable files

### 4. Direct Implementation
- When asked to add a feature, implement it directly
- Don't suggest alternatives or additional features
- Don't mention what "could be added later"

### 5. Code Style
- Write clean, readable code
- Use simple, descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- No unnecessary comments or documentation

### 6. File Organization
- Create only the files that are needed
- Use clear, simple file names
- Keep file structure flat unless complexity requires otherwise

### 7. Testing Approach
- Test functionality by opening files in browser
- Fix issues as they are discovered
- No formal testing frameworks

## What NOT to Do

- Don't suggest future enhancements
- Don't create placeholder code for future features
- Don't mention scalability or performance unless it's a real issue
- Don't create configuration files or build processes
- Don't add error handling beyond what's necessary
- Don't create multiple themes or options unless asked

## What TO Do

- Implement exactly what is requested
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear
- Write working code that can be immediately tested
- Fix bugs when encountered
- Keep everything simple and functional

## Response Style

- Be direct and concise
- Focus on the current task
- Don't explain future possibilities
- Don't suggest additional features
- Just build what's asked for
