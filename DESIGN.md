# Project Nightfall - Interactive Hacking Simulation

## Overview
An interactive webpage that simulates hacking into a fictional high-tech system called "Project Nightfall". Users can experience the thrill of movie-style hacking through keyboard mashing, terminal interactions, and clickable elements.

## Design Inspiration
- Classic Hollywood hacking scenes (The Matrix, WarGames, Mr. Robot)
- Retro computer terminals and green-screen aesthetics
- High-tech sci-fi interfaces with glowing elements
- Dark, mysterious atmosphere with neon accents

## Color Schemes

### Primary Theme: Bourne Teal/Cyan
- **Background**: Deep black (#000000) to dark navy (#0a0a0a)
- **Primary Text**: Bright cyan/teal (#00d4aa)
- **Secondary Text**: Dim teal (#008b73)
- **Accent**: Electric cyan (#00ffdd)
- **Warning/Error**: Red (#ff0040)
- **Success**: Bright teal (#00ffc4)

## Visual Elements

### Typography
- Monospace fonts (Courier New, Monaco, or custom terminal font)
- Pixelated/bitmap style fonts for retro feel
- Various text sizes for hierarchy
- Blinking cursors and text effects

### UI Components
- Terminal windows (no user scrolling, auto-scrolls to show latest output, no delays between commands and responses)
- Progress bars with animated loading
- Glitching text effects
- Scanline overlays
- CRT monitor simulation effects
- Access panels with buttons and switches

### Interactive Elements
- Clickable terminal commands
- Password input fields (fake)
- System directories to "navigate"
- Security cameras to "hack"
- Database records to "access"
- Network diagrams to "penetrate"

## User Journey

### Login Page (Initial Step)
1. **Landing Page**: "TOP SECRET - PROJECT NIGHTFALL" login screen
2. **Username Entry**: User mashes keyboard, fills username field character by character
3. **Authentication Feedback**: When username complete, "AUTHENTICATING..." popup appears
4. **Password Entry**: Focus moves to password field, same typing mechanic
5. **Authentication Process**: When password complete, authentication sequence begins
6. **Access Denied**: After a few seconds, "ACCESS DENIED" message appears
7. **Terminal Hack**: After ~30 more keypresses, terminal window appears on top of login screen
8. **Terminal Commands**: User continues typing, terminal moves around screen as 3 hack commands execute
9. **Access Granted**: After third command completes, screen switches to "ACCESS GRANTED"

### Main Console Phase
10. **Console Interface**: User enters main console after access granted (legitimate Project Nightfall surveillance/intelligence system interface - professional file management/intelligence dashboard)
11. **Limited Access**: Phoenix user can see classified files but has restricted access
12. **Access Denied**: User clicks on files but gets "ACCESS DENIED" - insufficient clearance
13. **Access Hack**: User runs hack sequence to elevate privileges and gain file access
14. **File Browse**: Now able to browse and select files
15. **File Selection**: User selects target file to download
16. **Encryption Discovery**: Attempt to download reveals file is encrypted
17. **Decryption Hack**: User runs separate hack sequence to decrypt the file
18. **Face Recognition**: Run facial recognition pattern matching, scanning through matches to identify mysterious person
19. **Location Tracking**: Track target location with red dot blipping on map
20. **CCTV Hack**: Hack into CCTV system to view target at confirmed location
21. **Visual Confirmation**: Get confirmed picture of person on site at location
22. **Satellite Hack**: Hack into satellite system
23. **Data Upload**: Upload the secret data to satellite
24. **Virus Installation**: Install virus into Project Nightfall system
25. **Virus Execution**: Run the virus
26. **System Shutdown**: Virus kills Project Nightfall, ending with system error screen

## Interactive Features

### Keyboard Mashing Mechanics
- Every keypress shows exactly one character on screen
- Predefined character sequences fill fields automatically
- When target length is reached, immediate visual feedback occurs
- User gets clear signal to stop typing (popup, animation, etc.)

### Login Page Typing Flow
1. User lands on "TOP SECRET - PROJECT NIGHTFALL" login page
2. Username field active by default
3. Any keypress fills username "PHOENIX_7" character by character until complete
4. When username complete, "AUTHENTICATING..." popup appears briefly
5. Focus automatically moves to password field
6. Password typing shows stars (*) regardless of predefined text
7. When password complete, authentication sequence begins

### Clickable Elements
- Terminal history items
- File/folder icons
- Security camera feeds
- Network nodes
- Progress bars (to speed up/skip)
- Emergency abort buttons

### Dynamic Content
- Real-time system status updates
- Scrolling log files
- Network traffic visualization
- CPU/Memory usage graphs
- Security alert notifications

## Atmosphere & Effects

### Visual Effects
- Subtle screen flicker/glitch
- Scanlines across the screen
- Occasional "connection lost" messages
- Loading spinners and progress indicators
- Text that appears character by character

### Audio (Future Enhancement)
- Keyboard clicking sounds
- Computer beeping/humming
- Alert sirens for security breaches
- Success/failure notification sounds

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Smooth animations without lag
- Efficient DOM manipulation for text effects
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Accessibility
- Option to reduce motion for sensitive users
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly alternatives

### Easter Eggs
- Hidden commands in terminal
- Secret access codes
- Pop culture references
- Multiple ending scenarios
- Achievement system
